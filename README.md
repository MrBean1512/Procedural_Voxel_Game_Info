# Procedural_Voxel_Game_Info
This is not an actual repository; I'm using this to compile information I've learned about developing a voxel game. This includes info about Near-Infinite Procedural World Generation, Procedural Meshes, LODs (Level of Detail), Mesh Stitching, Octrees, Chunks, and Compute Shaders.
